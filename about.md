This application is developed as part of the requirement for the **Coursera Data Science Capstone Course**. The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.

### Steps
1. Upon initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be displayed at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. User may then enter a partially complete sentence to begin the next word prediction.


### Results
1. Next word predicted is shown at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown as indication.

#### Note:
The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/justusfrantz/capstone)

Presentation Slide decks are available on the [RPubs page](http://rpubs.com/justusfrantz/capstone)
