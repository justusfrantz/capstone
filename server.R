# Back Off Algorithm
# Predict the next term of the user input sentence
# 1. For prediction of the next word, Quadgram is first used (first three words of Quadgram are the last three words of the user provided sentence).
# 2. If no Quadgram is found, back off to Trigram (first two words of Trigram are the last two words of the sentence).
# 3. If no Trigram is found, back off to Bigram (first word of Bigram is the last word of the sentence)
# 4. If no Bigram is found, back off to the most common word with highest frequency 'the' is returned.
